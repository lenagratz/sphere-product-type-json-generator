This component allows you to generate SPHERE.IO **ProductType** _JSON_ drafts from _CSV_ files in order to create those product types in your SPHERE.IO project.

## Getting started

If you just want to use the tool, we recommend to use [SPHERE.IO's impex platform](https://impex.sphere.io) to avoid any local installation - you only need your browser.

Nevertheless you can run the program locally. You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/download/) installed and simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install -g sphere-product-type-json-generator
```

And then run:
```
$ product-type-generator
```

The component requires two _CSV_ files:
* a _CSV_ file describing product attributes and their values (e.g. for type _Enumeration_)
* a _CSV_ file describing product types in general and the used attributes

> Please find some example CSV files in the [data](data) folder

### Posting generated product types
The generated JSON files can be used then to be directly imported via SPHERE.IO HTTP API to your project.
We provide a simple command to do that:

```bash
$ product-type-update
```

Simply pass the credentials and your file to import via `--source`. If you provide a **directory**, all `*.json` files inside that directory will be uploaded.

## Docker

[![Docker build](http://dockeri.co/image/sphereio/product-type-json-generator)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sphereio/product-type-json-generator/)

There is also a docker container for easy setup/execution.

Run docker container:
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/files/:/files sphereio/product-type-generator
```

Set an alias for repeated calls:
```bash
alias product-type='docker run -v /path/to/files/:/files sphereio/product-type-generator'
```

## Development

* Clone this repository and change into the directory
* Install all necessary dependencies with

  ```bash
